# Module 1 Final Project

In this project I used a data set from www.kaggle.com. The data has a wide range of information about film releases from the last 20 years. The data needed to be cleaned first before analyzed. The file is called 'movies.xls'.

I included a presentation pdf that shows my findings within the data, the bar charts are sourced from my jupyter notebook.

The jupyter notebook includes all of my technical work. I played around with different ideas, charted things I found interesting, and used the technical details to create my blog post and non-technical presentation.

I included a folder for 'plotimages'. This folder includes png files used in my non-technical presentation pdf.
